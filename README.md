# To-Do-List
This project is a simple and responsive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, check off, and remove tasks, with all tasks stored using localStorage so the list persists across sessions. The UI is styled for modern appearance and includes custom checked and unchecked icons
